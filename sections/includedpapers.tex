& \textit{ACS Applied Materials and Interfaces, submitted, (2023)} \\
&  \\
&  \textbf{My contribution:} \\
&  I have planned and performed the experiments, depositions,
GISAXS measurements, X-ray reflectivity and neutron reflectivity
measurements. I also wrote the software used to analyse the obtained
GISAXS data, analyzed the ERDA measurements, done the simulations
and fitting of the data and I wrote the manuscript. \\

&  \\
&  \textbf{My contribution:} \\
&  I have plannend and performed the experiment, the depositions, the
X-ray reflectivity and neutron reflectivity measurements, did the
XRD measurements, analyzed the ERDA data, did the simulations
and fitting of the X-ray reflectivity and neutron reflectivity data. And I wrote the manuscript. \\
