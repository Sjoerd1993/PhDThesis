abstract = {Trends in the performance of X-ray multilayer interference structures with periods ranging from 9 to 130 Å are reviewed. Analysis of near-normal incidence reflectance data versus photon energy reveals that the effective interface width σ in a static Debye-Waller model, describing interdiffusion and roughness, decreases as the multilayer period decreases, and reaches a lower limit of roughly 2 Å. Specular reflectance and diffuse scattering from uncoated and multilayer-coated substrates having different roughnesses suggest that this lower limit results largely from substrate roughness. The increase in interface width with period thus results from increasing roughness or interdiffusion as the layer thickness increases.}

In the quantum mechanical approach, the neutron can be treated as a wave with a characteristic wavelength, λ, defined by the de Broglie relation, λ = h/mnv, where h is Planck's constant, and mn and v are the neutron mass and speed, respectively. The Schrödinger equation is analogous to the wave equation for light and leads to neutrons showing characteristic optical behavior such as total reflection and refraction. A specular neutron reflection experiment measures the reflectivity as a function of the wave vector perpendicular to the reflecting surface, q. The measurement can be done by varying either the glancing angle of incidence θ at a constant wavelength or measuring the time-of-flight, hence wavelength, at constant θ. In most nuclear reactors, measurements are usually made at a fixed value of λ using long-wavelength neutrons and a θ (reflectionangle) - 2θ (detector angle) scan.}

Nevertheless, supermirrors are designed with the algorithms based on the theories of reflection from perfect layered structures. In the present paper an approach is suggested, in which the design of a supermirror is made on the basis of its real-structure model (the RSD algorithm) with the use of exact numerical methods. It allows taking the growth laws and the reflectance of real structures into account. The new algorithm was compared with the Gukasov–Ruban–Bedrizova (GRB) algorithm and with the most frequently used algorithm of Hayter and Mook (HM). Calculations showed that, when the parameters of the algorithms are chosen so that the supermirrors designed for a given angular acceptance m have the same number of bilayers, (a) for perfect layers the GRB, HM and RSD algorithms generate sequences of practically the same reflectance; (b) for real structures with rough interfaces and interdiffusion the GRB and HM algorithms generate sequences with insufficient number of thinner layers and the RSD algorithm turns out to be more responsive and efficient. The efficiency of the RSD algorithm increases for larger m. In addition, calculations have been carried out to demonstrate the effect of fabrication errors and absorption on the reflectance of Ni/Ti supermirrors.}

	abstract     = {Multilayer structures, analogous to broadband optical filters, may be used to reflect X-rays or neutrons at angles larger than the total external reflection angle intrinsic to the bulk mirror material. These so-called supermirrors have generally been designed using continuum theories, which predict that the thickness of the {\it j}th layer in the multilayer should vary smoothly as {\it j}${\sp {$-$}1/4}$. A new approach is proposed, based on considering the contribution of each bilayer to the extinction in a given stack of bilayers, and the discrete equations governing the choice of layer thicknesses are derived and solved. In the limit of zero layer thickness, the continuum result is recovered. The design produces essentially perfect reflectivity over the entire supermirror range. An optimal technique for trading reflectivity to gain angular range also emerges naturally from the physics of the design.}

As usual in scattering experiments, where the phase information is lost, it is necessary to build a model that can be used to calculate the reflectivity for comparison with the measured reflectivity. In the calculations, it is necessary to correct the calculated reflectivity from geometrical and resolution-function factors, which play a major role at low angles of incidence. These factors are presented in this paper and the corrected calculated intensity is compared with the measured reflectivity of a commercial silicon wafer and of a niobium film on a sapphire substrate.}

	abstract     = {For small samples, the modification of the X-ray reflectivity (XRR) profile by the geometric factors due to the profile and size of the beam and the size of the sample is significant. These geometric factors extend the spill-over angle, which is often greater than the critical angle for small samples. To separate the geometric factors, it is necessary to know the spill-over angle. Since the geometric factors are smoothly varying functions and extend beyond the critical angle, it is impossible to determine the spill-over angle from the XRR profile of small samples. It is shown that the spill-over angle can be determined by comparing the normal XRR profile of a small sample with the XRR profile taken with a surface-contact knife edge on the same sample. Thus, a procedure has been developed for data reduction for small samples and validated with suitable experiments. Unlike the methods used hitherto, which have drawbacks, this is a self-consistent method for data reduction.},

Their atoms are arranged in an ordered but non-periodic way. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was the right tool to discover such exotic materials and has always been a main technique in their studies since then. It provides the morphological and crystallographic information and images of real atomic arrangements of QCs. In this review, we summarized the achievements of the study of QCs using TEM, providing intriguing structural details of QCs unveiled by TEM analyses. The main findings on the symmetry, local atomic arrangement and chemical order of QCs are illustrated.}

The software combines a Python-language graphical front-end with a C code computing back-end in a user-friendly way. The software uses a list of coincident time-of-flight–energy (ToF–E) events as an input. The ToF calibration can be determined with a simple graphical procedure. The graphical interface allows the user to select different elements and isotopes from a ToF–E histogram and to convert the selections to individual elemental energy and depth profiles. The resulting sample composition can be presented as relative or absolute concentrations by integrating the depth profiles over user-defined ranges. Beam induced composition changes can be studied by displaying the event-based data in fractions relative to the substrate reference data. Optional angular input data allows for kinematic correction of the depth profiles. This open source software is distributed under the GPL license for Linux, Mac, and Windows environments.}
