# PhDThesis
This repository contains all raw LaTeX files and figures used to create my PhD dissertation. 
In the current state this is just a data dump of the raw folder, including all stress induces chaos, but I intend to clean this up over time and include the figures in more commonly usuable svg and png formats.

While the original thesis was created using a git repository as well, the original repository has been deleted to avoid potential copyright issues with yet unpublished articles. It is for the same reason that the unpublished articles have been removed from this repository as well. These will be attached in the future if they're published under a compatibile license, otherwise feel free to contact me to get a copy of said article at contact@sjoerd.se. Science should be shared and knowledge belongs to all of us, so I would be happy to provide such articles upon reasonable request.

Note that this work is all licensed under a CC-BY license, meaning you are free to copy, share and edit any of the figures or texts in this work, but attribution is required. The latest workable PDF of the thesis itself can be found as main.pdf.
