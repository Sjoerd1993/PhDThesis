# Multilayer neutron optics based on isotope enriched 11B4C
This repository contains all raw LaTeX files and figures used to create my PhD dissertation. 
In the current state this is just a data dump of the raw folder, including all stress-induced chaos, but I intend to clean this up over time and include the figures in more commonly usuable svg and png formats so that it may be of benefit to others.

While the original thesis was created using a private git repository for version control, the original repository and its commit history has been deleted to avoid potential copyright issues with yet unpublished articles. It is for the same reason that the unpublished articles have been removed from this repository as well. These will be attached in the future if they're published under a compatibile license, otherwise feel free to contact me to get a copy of said article at contact@sjoerd.se. Science should be shared and knowledge belongs to all of us, so I would be happy to provide such articles upon reasonable request.

Note that this work is all licensed under a CC-BY license, meaning you are free to use, copy, share and edit any of the figures or texts in this work, but attribution is required. The easiest is to simply cite the PhD thesis itself, which depending on the citation format will be something like `Stendahl, S. (2023). Multilayer neutron optics based on isotope-enriched 11B4C. Link√∂ping Studies in Science and Technology. Dissertations. https://doi.org/10.3384/9789180752305`. A BibTeX format can be retrieved from the linked website.
When using any of the figures, attribution may be omitted when explicit permission is granted by me per section 6c in the CC-BY license agreement. If this is required, send me an email at contact@sjoerd.se, and this may be arranged. 

The latest workable PDF of the thesis itself can be found as main.pdf, or on the right-hand side of the webpage under Releases.
