\chapter{Outlook}
In order to obtain structural parameters for the samples, the experimental reflectivity curves need to be fitted to mathematical simulations for each sample. There are several possible mathematical descriptions that can be used, within this work there are two different descriptions that are applied based on the software that has been used. Specular reflectivity is used described using the Paratt recursion formula, whilst the off-specular simulation is described using the Born-approximation. Both of these formalisms are described in this chapter.
